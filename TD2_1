##### Exercise 1: Grep and awk on tabular data

##### Question 1: Display the list of files and folders at the root using ls -l
ls -l /

##### Question 2. In a pipeline (using |), append a grep instruction to only display informations of bin
ls -l / | grep bin

##### Question 3. Append an awk instruction to only display the size of bin
ls -l / | grep bin | awk '{print $5}'

##### Question 4. Now rather extract the month, day and year of creation of the folder bin
ls -ld --time-style="+%Y-%b-%d" /bin | awk '{print $6}'

##### Question 5. Now rearrange the instruction to get the following output format : 2020-Oct-26 (from original data : Oct 26 2020)
ls -ld --time-style="+%Y-%b-%d" /bin | awk '{print $6 "-" $7 "-" $8}'

##### Exercise 2: Grep with Regex, and sed on unstructured data

##### Question 1. Run the following command :
curl https ://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cyberattacks > cyberattacks.txt

##### Question 2. Use grep to extract all the lines that contain the keyword "meta"
grep "meta" cyberattacks.txt

##### Question 3. Now only extract "meta" and the first following word. You might use grep options to enable the use of regex (Regular Expressions)
grep -o "meta [^ ]*" cyberattacks.txt

##### Question 4. Only extract the follwing word (but not the keyword "meta")
grep -o "meta \K[^ ]*" cyberattacks.txt

##### Question 5. Let’s now try more interesting (yet complex) patterns. You might use vim to open the file and look for useful patterns.
cat cyberattacks.txt | grep -A1 'id="Introduction"' | tail -n 1

##### Question 6. Your turn

— Extract the tab title
grep -o "<title>[^<]*" cyberattacks.txt | sed 's/<title>//'

— Make a list of cyber attacks based on section titles
grep -o 'span class="mw-headline" id="[^"]*"[^>]*>[^<]*' cyberattacks.txt | sed 's/<[^>]*>//g'
